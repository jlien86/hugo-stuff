## Welcome Programmers of All Levels!

### Who Am I?

I am an introductory-level developer who is trying to regain her skills after a five-year hiatus to care for my children. I am vision impaired, though not completely. I currently stay at home with my 3 kids. While most of the initial topics will be geared for beginners, I hope that any experienced developer might enjoy the content of this site.

### Details About This Site

This site was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an "open-source static site generator" written in   [GoLang](https://golang.org/). I do not take credit for it, nor any of the design. Any tweaks to the original theme for the sake of personalization are minimal at best.
