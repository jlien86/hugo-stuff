What is a programmer? What does he look like? We all seem to have the same image in our minds of what we think that looks like, right? While stereotypes are never fair, they seem to be our brain's default setting to any category of person. Job titles and hobbies are of no exception.
  
However, reality is something a bit more diverse. Coders are men and women, old and young,
experienced experts and those who are just starting out. They come from different countries and backgrounds from all around the world. Some have physical and learning disabilities. We have all of these diversities and yet we all revolve around one, single common interest: bowing to the almighty code! And that, is a beautiful thing.

What does any of this have to do with this blog? Not a whole lot, to be honest. Other than to say that there is ZERO reason to believe that you do NOT belong here. No matter who or where or how, YOU BELONG IN THE WORLD OF CODE! I am excited that you have decided to take this journey with me as I attempt to re-learn my skills and hopefully fill in some of the gaps that I never learned in the first go-round. Letâ€™s get jogramming!
